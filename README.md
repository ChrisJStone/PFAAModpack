# PFAA Modpack

This is a collection of the configuration and script/resource files used for all of the modpack's custom content and configuration.  This is not the full modpack.

Project Per Fabrica ad Astra (aka: Through crafting to the stars) is a hardcore technical-terrafirmacraft themed modpack designed for experienced players.

This pack aims at providing a complete, believable and smooth experience from stone age to interstellar travel, with heavy engineering content in mind and guided with quests and manuals.

Survive, mine, craft, design your base and your automations, manage your power generation and consumption, shape the world with your hands and in the end create the massive factory you have dreamed of.

This pack provides many unique challenges in automation, as there are no magic block which can solve every problem. You will need to use all available tools, transport belts, trains, servos, redstone gates, or even computers to control them all

The gameplay can be identified with a few “ages”:
- Stone age to Bronze age provided by vanilla TFC.
- Steel age – Basic industry with Immersive Engineering and Industrialcraft 2, unmanned resource extraction and great increase in resource processing efficiency.
- Petrochem age – Enhanced industry featuring chemistry and oil refining, powered by Magneticraft and IHL. Have you ever seen a real oil refinery?
- Aluminium age – Start of advanced rocketry, making advanced components and extracting minor elements from minerals.
- Titanium age – Basic space flight, moon landing, UUM and iridium production, experimental fusion devices.
- Tungsten age – Top-tier-insanely-complex material production, interstellar travel, ultimate productivity enhancement.
- Endgame – Mekanism self-sustainable fusion as the ultimate goal.

This pack is intended for multiplayer due to its complexity and design.
